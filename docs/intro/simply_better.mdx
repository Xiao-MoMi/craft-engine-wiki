## Open Source

CraftEngine's open-source nature embodies a shared vision for advancing Minecraft's ecosystem. By open-sourcing our architecture, we empower server owners to create custom experiences while raising modding standards through proven, transparent design patterns. Every line of code reflects battle-tested decisions, every document teaches, and every contribution pushes boundaries. Real progress comes from collaboration - where my innovations become your foundation, lifting the entire community.

:::info
CraftEngine is my passion project, not a primary income source. The plugin remains completely open-source and free for all to use. However, if you require my personal support, please consider a premium license - it directly supports development time and helps ensure the project's continued growth and improvement.

## The Ultimate Crafting System

CraftEngine offers the most stable and efficient crafting solution available. Our system supports nearly all vanilla recipe types (except a few special cases like map and firework crafting) and seamlessly integrates items from other plugins.

But here's what really sets us apart:

- Full compatibility with datapack recipes using item tags
- The most comprehensive tag support in the industry
- Unmatched stability and performance
- Post processors for recipe results

:::tip

Want to try a little experiment?

Try creating a simple furnace recipe in any other crafting plugin. Set up your ingredients, then rename them in an anvil before putting them in the furnace. Will the recipe still work?

Spoiler alert: It'll fail 99% of the time! That's due to Bukkit API limitations.

:::

:::caution

Unless you specifically need certain **beyond-vanilla** crafting features, CraftEngine is undoubtedly your best and only choice. Don't assume that single-purpose plugins specializing in one feature are inherently better than comprehensive solutions - that's simply not true.

## Expanded Block Settings

CraftEngine doesn't just let you set more block properties - like common attributes such as flammability, redstone conductivity, map colors, etc. It also allows you to define unique block behaviors. What's more, you can even register additional block behavior types through its API. It works just like modding!

:::warning

Some plugins try to implement features like leaf decay or falling blocks using Bukkit schedulers and Bukkit events, but these approaches are full of bugs and performance issues.

:::

:::tip

Try combining different patterns to make brand new mixed block mechanics.

For example, if you mix "on liquid block" with "crop block", you get crops that grow on water. Combine "falling block" and "lamp block", and youâ€™ll have a lamp that can fall like sand.

## Powerful Template System

CraftEngine offers an incredibly powerful template system. For highly complex configuration files, you just need to create a base template, set the required parameters, and then generate similar configurations in bulk.

```yaml
templates:
  default:loot_table/crop:
    pools:
      - rolls: 1
        entries:
          - type: item
            item: ${crop_item}
      - rolls: 1
        conditions:
          - type: match_block_property
            properties:
              age: ${ripe_age}
        entries:
          - type: item
            item: ${crop_item}
            functions:
              - type: apply_bonus
                enchantment: minecraft:fortune
                formula:
                  type: binomial_with_bonus_count
                  extra: 3
                  probability: 0.5714286
```

## Full Item Model Support

CraftEngine gives you complete control over 1.21.4 item model formats. You can make items look different in the inventory vs. in-hand, change appearances based on durability, or even display entirely different models depending on player language.

:::tip

Other similar plugins often simplify bow, crossbow, and other item configurations into just a few texture optionsâ€”severely limiting your ability to utilize advanced item model features.

CraftEngine takes a smarter approach: we provide pre-built templates for common items like bows, crossbows, tridents, and armor. Just pick the right template, fill in the required parameters, and youâ€™ll achieve the same (or better) results.

The catch? Youâ€™ll need to understand how templates and item models work first. But thatâ€™s exactly why CraftEngine offers deeper customization and a more modern solution compared to the competition. But don't worry - CraftEngine comes with comprehensive tutorials that will help you understand these elegant design choices.

## Better Furniture Implementation

Unlike other plugins, CraftEngine's furniture uses true entity mode. Why does that matter? Because entities can exist anywhere - no grid-locking. Other plugins force strict placement rules, but CraftEngine breaks all those limits. Picture this: placing a cake perfectly on a dinner plate. Other plugins? Couldn't do it. Here? No problem."

:::caution

Need hard or glowing furniture? Use BLOCKS, not furniture! CraftEngine doesn't fake it like other plugins - that approach is fundamentally flawed.

Minecraft's doesn't allow entities to emit real light. Other plugins hack this with buggy workarounds that break with falling blocks.
